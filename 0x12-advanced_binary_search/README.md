## Advanced Binary Search 

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.

    Prototype : int advanced_binary(int *array, size_t size, int value);
    array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
    size is the number of elements in array
    value is the value to search for
    Your function must return the index where value is located
    You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
    If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
    Every time you split the array, you have to print the new array (or subarray) you’re searching in (See example)
    You have to use recursion. You may only use one loop (while, for, do while, etc.) in order to print the array
